==========================

Tidy data project for Getting and Cleaning Data course in Coursera's Data Science Specialization.

## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the run_analysis.R file, the README.md file and the CodeBook.md file which describes the variables and data.

### Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

A full description of the dataset is available at the site where the data was obtained: (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

This project's source data can be found here:(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

### Note on working directory for run_analysis.R

The working directory is set on line 1 of run_analysis.R.  You will either need to duplicate this directory or change it to a preferred directory path on the machine the script will be run.

### Project Summary

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
